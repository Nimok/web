title: Closed testing will start in July 2023
description: Frost Giant Studios announced on Reddit that closed testing will start in July 2023 with a pre-alpha phase and ending with a beta phase that will extend into 2024. All who signed up on the website will be eligible for an invite but not guaranteed to get in. Early phases will focus on core functionality, 1v1, and the Human Resistance, with other factions and modes added later. The closed testing, especially early phases, will be under NDA with very likely no streaming or in-game screenshots allowed.
